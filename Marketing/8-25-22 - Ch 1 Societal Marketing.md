Objectives for today
	-Define
		-Social Responsibility
		-Societal Marketing
		-Cause-related marketing
	-Understand
		-The perceived evil in marketing and the resulting consumer rights
		-The role of 'for-profit' businesses in facing societal problems
		-The fundamentals of cause-related marketing

Shareholder orientation can
	-Create very short-term perspectives
	-Encourage behavior that maximizes shareholder value at the expense of a business's health

Social Responsibility
	-Companies acting in part for the best interest of society rather than their own self-interest

The AMA calls on marketers to
	-Do no evil
	-Foster trust in the marketing system
	-Embrace ethical values of
		-honesty, responsibility, fairness, respect, transparency, and citizenship

Societal Marketing
	-Micro/Macro Dilemma
	-A company makes marketing decisions of considering:
		-Consumer's wants
		-The company's requirements
		-Consumers long-run interests
		-Society's long-run interests

Corporate Purpose:

Are there self-interested reasons to engage in a societal orientation?
	-The WEF found that increased trust results in:
			-Enhanced innovation and entrepreneurship
			-More loyal, productive, and engaged employee relationships
			-Stronger external relationships up and down the value chain
			-Greater resilience to withstand shocks and crises
	-CSR spending has been linked to reducing firm-idiosyncratic risk in stock prices (e.g. variability)
	-Firms are rewarded when:
		-Quality is strong
		-Stakeholders make intrinsic attributions about a firm's motive
		-CSR spending is synergistic with R&D
		-Advertising spending is higher compared to competitors

What actually happens/works?
	*Note: CSI == !CSR*
	-Slack (extra) resources: $ -> CSR Spending
	-Good management: CSR -> $
	-Penance (Get in trouble): CSI -> CSR
	-Insurance: CSR -> CSI
	**Most typical:** Penance and Good Management

An argument can be made for companies to engage more broadly than the Friedman view of business (e.g. social responsibility) because:
	-The issues the world faces are huge
	-Companies control the resources (capital, social, etc)
	-Consumers want business to engage in some issues
	-NGOs are penalized for marketing

------

Cause-related Marketing
	-When charitable actions of a firm are tied directly to consumer revenue
	-"Buy one of these and we'll give *x* to so-and-so"
	-The amount given is dependant on the amount purchased (unlike CSR)

Brands and Cause must fit
	-Conceptual congruence
		-Corporate values
		-Target market
		-Product positioning
		-Mission
		-Brand personality
	Perceptual congruence
		-Color composition
		-Size
		-Shape
		-Visibility
