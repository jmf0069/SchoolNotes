Marketing Strategy
	-Plan of action used to achieve a goal
	-**Specifies a target market and a marketing mix**
	-Which customers will we serve (segmentation and targeting)? How will we offer value to them (differentiation and positioning)

Mission Statement
	-Definition of the firm's business focus that provides direction for the company

Marketing Myopia
	-Defining a company too narrowly and focusing on the company instead of the customer and missing key environmental trends
	-The mistake of paying more attention to the specific products a company  offers than to the benefits and experiences produced by these products
	-Example
		-The passenger railroad industry (Amtrak) focused on being a railroad business rather than a transportation business. This caused them to die off due to transportation evolution
		-Netflix went from mail-order movies to streaming and filming. Defined themselves as a general media company rather than just a mail-order movie company
		-Amazon can be **too broad** at times - causes some misses, some successes
	-If you're too narrow, you will die out to competitors
	-If you're too broad, you will have many failures (but still some successes)

Takeaways:
	-All industries are growth industries at some point
	-A product focus will almost inevitably lead to a company's demise at some point
	-A lack of focus will mean a company is all over the place
	-The right focus doesn't guarantee success
