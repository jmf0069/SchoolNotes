The high impact of pricing
	- ![[Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 1.06.58 PM.png]]
	- Increasing unit sales increases costs
	- Most profit gains when increasing price as compared to unit sales, variable and fixed costs

Price
	- Pricing is the reflection of everything you do as a business
	- "The single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power" Warren Buffet

Pricing Based on Cost vs Value vs Competition
	- Cost-based pricing
		- Setting prices based on costs (especially variable costs)
	- Value-based pricing
		- Setting the price based on what customers are willing to pay

Psychological Concepts
	- Reference Price
		- An expectation of the price of a product
	- Processing Fluency
		- The ease in which consumers process information
	- Odd / Even Pricing
		- ![[Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 1.23.28 PM.png]]
		- Using non-rounded prices gives the effect of a cheaper overall price for a product. Using 39.96 instead of 40.00 makes people think the item is cheaper
		- Housing market uses rounded numbers because rounded numbers prove better for emotional purchases
		- Rounded numbers are better for emotional purchases, while non-rounded numbers are better for cognitive purchases
		- The size of the font affects how the price of the product feels
			- The smaller the font, the smaller the price feels (and vice versa)
		- The placement of the price affects how a person perceives the price
			- Bottom left price makes the price feel smaller
			- Things on the left are smaller, things on the right are bigger
			- Things on bottom are smaller, things on the top are bigger

	- Price Priming
		- ![[Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 1.34.12 PM.png]]
		- Reference prices are affected by primed numbers to the consumers
		- Odd/Even pricing (Processing fluency)  
			- Odd prices ending in .99 are seen as cheaper than the price that is 1 penny higher because of left digit processing.  
			- But round pricing is processed fluently which works better for emotional purchases.  
			 - Non-round prices take more resources to process and change the “measuring stick” by which a product is judged.  
		- Price sizes (Processing fluency)  
			- Smaller sized prices are perceived as smaller in magnitude.  
		- Price placement (Processing fluency)  
			- Directional cues carry connotations (up = prestige/ down = non-prestige / left = small / right = big) such that prices in the lower left corner will seem smaller in magnitude  
		- Price priming (reference price)  
			- Priming a large number will make a reference price higher and people more willing to pay a higher price  
		- Decoys (reference price)  
			- Decoys set the reference price which can make a superior option look better  
		- Pain of payment  
			- Paying is painful so having payment before consumption, using funny money, and removing dollar signs increases purchase and satisfaction

Price Elasticity of Demand
	-Elasticity measures the responsiveness of demand to changes in price
	-![[Screen Shot 2022-10-27 at 12.43.01 PM.png]]
	-Percent Change = (x2-x1)/x1
	-Changes in price produce:
		- Relatively elastic demand: ...proportionately **larger** changes in quantity. Occurs in situations when **elasticity is greater than one**
		- Relatively inelastic demand: ...proportionately **smaller** changes in quantity. Occurs in situations when **elasticity is less than one**
	- The % change in demand is **greater** than the % change in price
		- -.75 / .5 = -1.5, Therefore demand is elastic
	- Demand Curve 
		- "If your price isn't making someone mad, then it's too low"
		- ![[Screen Shot 2022-10-27 at 12.44.13 PM.png]]
	- Factors Influencing Elasticity
		- Substitutes
			- More substitutes = more elastic
		- Necessities
			- More necessary = less elastic
		- % of disposable income
			- High $% = more elastic

What does marketing do to a product's price elasticity
	- Starbucks made it okay for a cup of coffee to be 3-5 dollars compared to 1 dollar before they pushed their marketing

How can we make pricing fully value-based?
	- Price Discrimination
		- Charging different customers a different price for the same thing (at roughly the same time)
	- From the book
		- "Technically, price discrimination is illegal..."
		- “The Sherman Antitrust Act, Clayton Antitrust Act, and Robinson-Patman Act outlaw price discrimination when the intent of that discrimination is to harm competitors.”
		- “Price discriminations are generally lawful, particularly if they reflect the different costs of dealing with different buyers or are the result of a seller's attempts to meet a competitor's offering.”
	- Who are these people at the top of the demand curve?
		- Velveeta
			- "We found a hard-core group of Velveeta fans. They constituted 10% of buyers but accounted for 30% to 40% of revenue and more than 50% of profits....a group whose size we estimated at 2.4 million."
			- “The previous thinking was that the quickest, easiest path to growth was to identify light users or lapsed users...But when we talked to superconsumers, we learned that in fact they wanted to use Velveeta more—they were starving for it.” The new product launches have generated more than $100 million in sales.
		- Superconsumers
			- Superconsumers are defined by both economics and attitude: They are a subset of heavy users who are highly engaged with a category and a brand. They are especially interested in innovative uses for the product and in new variations on it. They aren’t particularly price sensitive.
			- Staplers are a prime example. Most people have just a single stapler—or maybe two, one at home and one in the office. But we identified stapler superconsumers, who own eight staplers each, on average.
	- Price Discrimination Method #1
		- Change prices to charge customers exactly what they are willing to pay
		- Examples
			- Dynamic pricing
				- Changing the price constantly to match competitors or customer demand
			- Discounts
		- Determinants of perceived unfairness
			- Perceptions of excessive profit
			- Perceived immorality
			- Inability to understand pricing strategy
			- Reputation
	- Price Discrimination Method #2
		- Allow customers to pay exactly what they are willing
			- "Pay what you want"
		- 2 Industries were profitable
			- Restaurants and Coffee Shops
		- 1 Industry was not profitable
			- Movies
		- Minimum suggested price sets the reference price, causes the establishment to lose money
			- Make it higher (Smithsonian @ $20)
	- What happens when you add social responsibility?
		- Results from 113000 amusement park customers

		- Attaching a charity to the cost can increase profits

To summarize price discrimination
	- We price discriminaste because customers' willingness to pay is varied
	- There are many ways to do so, we went over 2 methods. Some methods are more likely to lead to perceptions of unfairness (dynamic pricing) compared to others (PWYW and discounts)
	- PWYW is not viable for all products, but the combination of PWYW with a social cause can be particularly good
