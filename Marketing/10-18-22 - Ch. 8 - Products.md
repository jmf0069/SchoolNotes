Service-based Economy
	-A continuum

	-Service Characteristics
		-Intangibility
			-Services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled before purchases
		-Variability
			-Quality of services depends on who provides them and when, where, and how
		-Inseparability
			-Services cannot be seperated from their providers
		-Perishability
			-Services cannot be stored for later sale or use
		-Ownership
			-The customer doesn't technically receive ownership of some services, whereas with products they do receive ownership of the product
	-How characteristics affect marketing
		-Intangibility
			-Intangible products are harder to assess. Benefits of intangible products must be made tangible. Tangible products often push intangible benefits to take advantage of the lasting power of abstract concepts in memory. Also, assessing the cost of a “unit of service” is difficult.
		-Variability
			-A heterogeneous product cannot be standardized, so it is harder to take advantage of economies of scale. Also, a heterogeneous product has greater FLE and customer input and therefore quality is harder to control.
		-Inseperability
			-An inseparable product must be produced in front of and along with customers. Quality is hard to achieve and assess for the organization. Also, the customer must be accommodated within the servicescape creating capacity issues. Mass production and economy of scale is difficult to obtain. Customers impact each other.
		-Perishability
			-A perishable product cannot be produced ahead of time, so demand must be forecast. A perishable product cannot be returned for a comparable product and therefore, additional remedies must be offered.
		-Ownership
			-Products will often be judged based on the quality of the transferred object. The object will often be considered the core product whereas everything else is periphery. When there is no ownership transfer, other things start to become more relevant such as relationships and tangible cues

Product Life-Cycle
	-The pattern of growing and declining sales in a product category
	-Product life cycles are affected by the competition that comes from multiple brands, which is why explaining them at the product category level is the preferred approach
	-Sales and Profits over the Product's Life from Inception to Decline

Variations in the Product Life-Cycle
