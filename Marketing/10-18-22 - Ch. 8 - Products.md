Service-based Economy
	-A continuum

	-Service Characteristics
		-Intangibility
			-Services cannot be seen, tasted, felt, heard, or smelled before purchases
		-Variability
			-Quality of services depends on who provides them and when, where, and how
		-Inseparability
			-Services cannot be seperated from their providers
		-Perishability
			-Services cannot be stored for later sale or use
		-Ownership
			-The customer doesn't technically receive ownership of some services, whereas with products they do receive ownership of the product
	-How characteristics affect marketing
		-Intangibility
			-Intangible products are harder to assess. Benefits of intangible products must be made tangible. Tangible products often push intangible benefits to take advantage of the lasting power of abstract concepts in memory. Also, assessing the cost of a “unit of service” is difficult.
		-Variability
			-A heterogeneous product cannot be standardized, so it is harder to take advantage of economies of scale. Also, a heterogeneous product has greater FLE and customer input and therefore quality is harder to control.
		-Inseperability
			-An inseparable product must be produced in front of and along with customers. Quality is hard to achieve and assess for the organization. Also, the customer must be accommodated within the servicescape creating capacity issues. Mass production and economy of scale is difficult to obtain. Customers impact each other.
		-Perishability
			-A perishable product cannot be produced ahead of time, so demand must be forecast. A perishable product cannot be returned for a comparable product and therefore, additional remedies must be offered.
		-Ownership
			-Products will often be judged based on the quality of the transferred object. The object will often be considered the core product whereas everything else is periphery. When there is no ownership transfer, other things start to become more relevant such as relationships and tangible cues

Product Life-Cycle
	-The pattern of growing and declining sales in a product category
	-Product life cycles are affected by the competition that comes from multiple brands, which is why explaining them at the product category level is the preferred approach
	-Sales and Profits over the Product's Life from Inception to Decline

Variations in the Product Life-Cycle
	-Short Lifecycle (Bad)

	-Cyclical Lifecycle (Better)

	-Elongated Lifecycle (Best)

Innovative New Products
	-Innovation is an improvement in a products ability to deliver its primary benefit to its customer, and we can distinguish between two types of innovations:
		-Discontinuous Innovation
			-Large jumps in products benefit-delivering abilities
			-e.g. Apple's first iPhone back in the 2000's.
				-5-Hour Energy - created by a monk, thought what if the tired person wasn't thirsty?
				-Tesla - Experts told Tesla that they could combine some barely available technologies to create a sleek and fast electric vehicle
				-DayBreaker
					-Discontinuous because the benefit to the attendees are vastly different from normal night-time raves
		-Continuous Innovations
			-Smaller incremental improvements to products benefit-delivering abilities
			-e.g. Apple's new iPhones every year, CoD
				-Quirky
					-Small changes to already existing products (bending extension cord)
	-"This finding fits well with emerging thinking in the technology management area that suggests that listening closely to current customers actually might mislead and hurt firms"
		-Customers can mislead and hurt firms if listened to.
		-Customers are good for continuous innovations, small changes
	-**What can we deduce?**
		-Innovative ideas with strong market potential tend to come from "experts" in the field who combine newly emerging and existing technologies
		-Consumers are good for validating (i.e. testing) and evolving but not for creating discontinuous innovations
		-It is hard for a single person to come up with more than one innovative product that changes a market
	-How do you make it happen?
		-Explore, Expose, and Exploit
		-Try a bunch of different things until you capture the lightning in the bottle

	-Though consumers are not good at thinking of innovative products, they are better at screening them than experts... even with sample sizes of 20
	-Some people think planning is most important because there are no new ideas, variation in sales comes from execution
		-However, research suggests that 1 SD difference in idea quality translates into 50% change in sales
		-... if 300% sales stems from idea quality (i.e. generation), what role is luck?
