**Links: Physical Media**

**bit**: Propagates between transmitter/receiver pairs
**physical link:** what lies between transmitter and receiver
**guided media**: signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax
**unguided media:** signals propagate feely (e.g. radio)
**twisted pair (TP)**
	-Two insulated copper wires
		-Cat 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps ethernet
		-Cat 6: 10 Gbps

**Links: Physical Media: COAX, FIBER**
	-Coaxial cable
		-Two concentric copper conductors
		-Bidirectional
		-Broadband
			-Multiple frequency channels on cable
			-100's Mbps per channel
	-Fiber optic cable
		-Glass fiber carrying light pulses, each pulse a bit
		-High-speed operation
			-High-speed point-to-point transmission (e.g. 10's-100's Gbps transmission rate)
		-Low error rate
			-Repeaters spaced far apart
			-Immune to electromagnetic noise

Links: Physical Media: Radio
	-Wireless Radio
		-Signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum
		-No physical "wire"
		-Bidirectional
		-Propogation environment effects
			-Reflection
			-Obstruction by objects
			-Interference
	-Radio Link Types
		-Terrestrial microwave
			-e.g. up to 45 Mbps channels
		-LAN (WiFi)
			-Up to 100's Mbps
		-Wide-area (e.g. cellular)
			-4G Cellular: ~10 Mbps
		-Satellite
			-Kbps to 45 Mbps channel (or multiple smaller channels)
			-270 ms end-end delay
			-Geosynchronous versus low altitude
