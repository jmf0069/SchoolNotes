HTTP Overview
	-HHTP: Typertext Transfer Protocol
	-Web's application layer protocol
	-Client-server model
		-Client
			-Browser that requests, receives (using HTTP protocol) and displays web objects
		-Server
			-Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests
	-HTTP uses TCP
		-Client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80
		-Server accepts TCP connection from client
		-HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
		-TCP connection closed
	-HTTP is stateless
		-Server maintains no information about past clients requests
	-*Note*
		-Protocols that maintain states are complex!
			-Past history (state) must be maintained
			-If server/client crashes, their views of state may be inconsistent, must be reconciled
