HTTP Connections: Two types
	Non-persistent HTTP
		-TCP connection opened
		-At most one object sent over TCP connection
		-TCP connection closed

	-Downloading multiple objects required multiple connections
	Persistent HTTP
		-TCP connection opened to a server
		-Multiple objects can be sent over single TCP connection between client and server
		-TCP connection closed
Non-Persistent HTTP: Response Time
	-RTT
		-Time for a small packet to travel from client to server and back (Round-trip)
	-HTTP response time
		-One RTT to initiate TCP connection
		-One RTT for HTTP request and first few bytes of HTTP response to return
		-File transmission time
		**-Non-persistent HTTP response time = 2(RTT) + File Transmission Time**

Non-Persistent HTTP (1.0) Issues
	-Requires 2 RTT per object
	-OS overhead for each TCP connection
	-Browsers often open parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects

Persistent HTTP (1.1)
	-Server leaves connection open after sending response
	-Subsequent HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection
	-Client sends requests as soon as it encounters a referenced object
	-As little as one RTT for all the referenced objects (cutting response time in half)
