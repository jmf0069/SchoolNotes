**Why TCP/IP?**

Other Networks:
	-OSI: Open System Interconnection
	-IBM: SNA
	-Xerox: XNA
	-Dec: DecNet
	-Telephone Networks (ATT, Verizon)

*ISO: International Systems Organization*
**TCP/IP vs ISO OSI**
	ISO:
		-Complex Network (more reliable)
		-Congestion Control
		-Circuit switching for packets
	TCP/IP
		-Complexity at **edge of network** in end-to-end layer (transport layer. reliability/congestion control)
		-Simple network layer. IP is simple and 
		-IP uses datagram packet switching
			-No reliability (barebones)
			-Best Effort delivery approach
			-Stateless routers
				-After router forwards packet, the router does not remember that it forwarded the packet
			-Decentralized algorithms
